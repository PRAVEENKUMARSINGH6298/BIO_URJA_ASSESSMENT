# BIO_URJA_ASSESSMENT

In my opinion, this problem can be solved within certain constraints, allowing for a degree of error. After processing the data, the closest achievable output was 12000.48, with an error of only 8%.
Obtaining an exact output of 12000 with no error in the distribution of power among zonal wind farms may or may not be feasible because processing all 100 factorial permutations can be time-consuming.
